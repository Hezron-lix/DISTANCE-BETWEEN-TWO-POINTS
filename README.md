# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
### Step 2: 
Mention the coordinates as given
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Assign the values of coordinates in the formula
### Step 5: 
End the program

### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)

print(round(d,2))
```
### OUTPUT:
